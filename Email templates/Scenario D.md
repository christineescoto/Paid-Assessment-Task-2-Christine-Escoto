# Scenario D
Dear Dennis,

Good day.
Again, congratulations on being admitted to the *Tech Fellow Program*. We truly appreciate your enthusiasm and prudent completion of all our requirements. However, we apologize that we cannot admit you to your classes yet because the organization needs at least two Tech Fellows from the same university, who are eligible and have completed all requirements, in order to proceed with your application. With this, we ask you to be more patient as it may take a month in processing other applicants; but rest assured that we will get back to you once we admitted another student from your school. For the time being, we highly suggest that you prepare for the upcoming school year by having a light reading of your books, and taking a rest as the school year ahead will be another challenging yet memorable journey for you. 

We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing you soon. 

Sincerely, 
**Christine Nicole Escoto
