# Scenario A
Dear John, 

Good day!
We hope you are doing fine, and we would like to congratulate you again for being qualified in the *Beginner Track* of the Interview Prep Program. Please know that we are grateful for highly qualified applicants such as yourself to be joining us in this program. However, we are sorry to inform you that we cannot grant your request of being transferred to the Advanced Track at this time. The deliberation of our applicants’ admission involves a thorough assessment of their credentials and technical skills interview that is parallel to the pre-requisite skills needed for each track. This is because we do not want to put our students in a class that is too basic or too advanced for them wherein the course won’t be able to serve its purpose. We ensure you that the topics included in your track will greatly equip you with the essential tools and knowledge to ace your technical interviews. You may check [Beginner Track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/intermediate_software_eng/overview) to give you an idea of what we have in store for you in this program. 


We hope you understand our decision and that you’ll have a great time in our program. If you still have questions about our program, feel free to send us a message again.

Sincerely, 
**Christine Nicole Escoto
Admissions Staff – CodePath.Org**
