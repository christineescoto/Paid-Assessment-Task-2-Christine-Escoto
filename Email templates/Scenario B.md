# Scenario B
Dear Jane, 

Happy Holidays! 
Thank you for your interest in applying to be one of our students in **CodePath.Org**. And we highly appreciate your effort in completing all the necessary steps in the application, most especially your pre-work app. Unfortunately, based on our assessment, you are ineligible for admission at this time. As much as we want to accommodate all applicants, CodePath is a non-profit organization, and we only rely on the sponsorships we receive which is why our courses are only restricted to those who are enrolled in universities within the US. Although there is still no definite time and decision, our administration has been looking for expansion in other countries and continents to help more aspiring tech students from all over the world; besides we are already running classes in Haiti and used to run classes in Taiwan. In the meantime, we will keep your application and will surely review it again when we can already accommodate students from your country. 

We hope you understand, and we wish you a great future ahead. 

Sincerely, 
**Christine Nicole Escoto
Admissions Staff - CodePath.Org**
