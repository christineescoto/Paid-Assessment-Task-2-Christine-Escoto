Dear Anne, 

Happy Holidays!
Thank you for your interest in applying for the *Summer Interview Prep Program*. Unfortunately, we cannot proceed with your application because admissions closed 2 weeks ago and this program is already full. As much as we want to consider all our applicants, we have a long list of waitlisted students already. Also, we are fully aware that you will graduate this coming spring and will be ineligible to apply next year; with this, we are truly sorry. In order to help you gear up for your upcoming interviews, we will share with you our [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) containing tips and guidelines which can serve as your guide in acing your interviews. You may also want to check our [resources page](https://www.codepath.org/dev-resources) for free access to up-to-date information that senior programmers use to build applications. We also encourage you to sign up on our [mailing list](https://www.codepath.org/contact), so that we can send updates on future courses and events that you may be interested in attending. 

Congratulations on your graduation and we bid you good luck on your next journey ahead. 

Sincerely,
**Christine Nicole Escoto
Admissions Staff - CodePath.Org**
